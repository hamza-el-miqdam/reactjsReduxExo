#The First deliverable for the exercise in 5 days</br>
<h3>Objective : editing the web app interface using "react inline styles",</h3></br>

  <p>=> components/App.js : adding a title and some div markups to have a code more organised, centering the elements, changing the colors, adding borders.</p>
  <p>=> components/Todo.js : centering the list items, removing the dots in the beginning of the list items, adding a border in the bottom of each one of them.</p>
  <p>=> components/TodoList.js : putting the list in the center.</p>
  <p>=> containers/AddTodo.js : adding style to the button (border, colors, pointer, hover...),centering the elements, adding style to the input markup and the placeholder.</p>


#The Second deliverable for the exercise</br>
<h3>Objective : changing the functionalities of the web app</h3></br>

  <p>=>actions/index.js: adding action creators for the 3 buttons validate, invalidate and confirm.</p>
  <p>=>components/Todo.js: adding 3 buttons validate, invalidate and confirm, adding 5 props: valid as number(0 for possible state,1 for valid state, 2 for invalid state), confirm as a boolean , 3 function for the onclick function for each one of the buttons.</p>
  <p>=>components/TodoList.js: linking the 3 functions with others functions that takes the "TodoId" as an argument</p>
  <p>=>containers/visibleTodoList.js: rewrite the mapDispatchToProps function which is a function that is used to regroup all the action creators with their events.</p>
  <p>=>reducers/todos.js : modify the reducers to execute the needed transformation when the action is detected. the reducer todo changes the state of the todos objects, and the todos reducer creates a new store object without altering the old stores object of the application.</p>

#Conclusion:
<p>This is actually the first time I work with ReactJS, Redux Framework and ES6/ES2015.In fact, I found at first some difficulties to understand the syntax of ES6 and the way Redux works, but by following some tutorials, I started learning how ReactJS works and how to use it efficially, especially "React Inline Styles" that I used for the first part of this exercise. After that, I started working on Redux, and then I analyzed the code of the application to find the instructions that should be modified or added. It was hard  to decide the things to change but after a lot of perseverance and concentration while reading the code I knew what needed to be modified.
</p>
<p>Finally, I really liked the logic behind Redux as it follows a special architecture and a new whole way of thinking the web apps. Also, I enjoyed spending time working in this project and using ReactJS. Additionaly, The JavaScript new syntax is really great, I loved it because it makes coding easier, faster and friendly.</p>
